"""Test RandomX proof-of-work.

This test verifies that Botcoin uses RandomX for block validation instead of SHA256d.

Acceptance Criteria (from specs/randomx.md):
1. RandomX library compiles and links with Botcoin
2. Block validation uses RandomX hash (not SHA-256d)
3. Valid RandomX proof-of-work is accepted
4. Mining RPC produces valid RandomX proofs
5. Seed hash rotates correctly every 2048 blocks with 64-block lag
